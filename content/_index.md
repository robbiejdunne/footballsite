description: I am a journalist and Data Science student from Ireland. I studied Python on my own until I realised it was time to back my lunchbox and schoolbag and go back to the classroom. I am currently studying a Data Science and Analytics and having a blast. I didn’t have a place where I could publish a lot of the writing and tinkering I do so I created a website to host it. If you care to know what I’ve read or am currently reading, you might want a gander at my bookshelf. If you have any questions, want to chat about one of my posts or need help getting started, you can find me over on Twitter.
