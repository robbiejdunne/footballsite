I found this book very interesting as it links back to another book I read recently about, basically, trusting your gut. 

As Joseph Weizebbaun said: "far beyond computers being made to serve humans. Humans are being make to serve computers."

I think that the way things work is that they become so ubiqituous within society that they become cliches. This is true of the use of data. It has gotten to the point where you hear regularly that data is the future, 

telling us how we think â€” we trust our gut less and need to be told how we are feeling.
